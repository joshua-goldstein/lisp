### Expressions
  - Something that is evaluated
  - Integers, floating-point expressions, complex numbers, fractions, giant numbers
  - Strings, characters, control characters
  - nil, t
  - Expressions divided into lists and atoms
  - Lists: (symbol expr1 expr2 ... )

  - Functions which return true or false are predicates
